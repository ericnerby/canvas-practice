# Canvas Practice

I wanted to understand the html `<canvas>` element better, so I went through my own version of Chris Course's Youtube series [HTML5 Canvas Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/EO6OkltgudE).

I took Chris' tutorial further by utilizing ES6 features that didn't exist at the time of the tutorial. These include:
* Arrow functions
* Class definitions
* Deconstruction

Overall, I tried to make my version more modular and object oriented while also utilizing more modern JS features.
